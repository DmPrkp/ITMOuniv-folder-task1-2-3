                    <td align="left" class="text"> The first civilization in North Caucasus is dating between the end of the 4th millennium and the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C. In that dates have been found (but little studied) dolmens structures. Most of them are represented by rectangular structures made of stone slabs or cut in rocks with holes in their fa√ßade. These dolmens cover the Western Caucasus on both sides of the mountain ridge, in an area of approximately 12, 000 kilometers of Russia.
                        <br>
                        The Caucasian dolmens represent a unique type of prehistoric architecture, built with precisely dressed large stone blocks. The stone were, for example, shaped into 90-degree angles, to be used as corners or were curved to make a circle. While generally unknown in the rest of Europe, these structures are equal to the great megaliths of Europe in terms of age and quality of architecture but are still of an unknown origin. In spite of Caucasian monuments they show strong similarities with megaliths form different parts of Europe and Asia. A range of hypotheses has been put forward to explain these similarities and the building of megaliths on the whole, but still it remains unclear.<br>
                        Approximately 3000 of these megalithic monuments are known in the Western Caucasus, but more are constantly being fond, while some are being destroyed. Today, many are in great disrepair and will be completely lost if they are not protected from vandals and general neglect. The North Caucasus Dolmens make up a lost city by the invading Scythians around the first millennium BC. The dolmens cloud have been of spiritual significance, and are becoming cherished again today.</td>
